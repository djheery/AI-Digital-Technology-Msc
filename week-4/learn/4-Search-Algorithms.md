# Search Algorithms 

The lecture states that 

"In optimization problems, the goal state is the solution, and the path to the goal is not important or relevant".

Defintions: 

- **State Space**
  - This set of problem can be defined as state space 
    - The complete set of configurations of the problem 
- **Goal**
  - The goal is to find a configuration that satisfies all constraints
    - This can be represented as an evaluation function 
    - There is no goal state nor any path costs.
