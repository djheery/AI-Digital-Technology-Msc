# Genetic Operators 

The crossover operator exchanges parts of chromosomes between a pair of individuals.

The mutation operator changes some parts of one individual by itself. 

There is a diagram on this page that shows the process:

A genetic operators diagram, which begins with an input P (pair) and I (individual). These feed into a genetic operations stage which can occur through crossover (represented by two rows of blocks with separate colours that are then merged) or mutation (represented by a row of white blocks which become a row of white blocks with one grey). After this stage, there are a series of flow diagram questions to determine validity and these lead to an output stage which is a replication of the input.
