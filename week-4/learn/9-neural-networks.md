# Neural Networks 

A neural Network is an information processing paradigm.
Neural Networks are inspired by bilogical nervous systems, such as the human brain. 

This method of computing is based on the interaction of multiple connected processing elements. 

It has the ability to learn from experiences in order to improve/ optimize performance.

It also has the ability to deal with incomplete information. 

There are many different types of neural networks, many different implementations and many different applications.

The feedforward back propagation networks are the most well-studied and applied.
