# Genetic Algorithms 

**Paradigm**: a typical example or pattern of something; a pattern or model.

Genetic Algorithms are based on the Darwinian Paradigm. 
Genetic Algorithms are used to simulate the natural evolution process. 

In this process a successor state is genreated by combining two parent states. 

To begin the process a set of randomly generated states, such as population, and a state is represented as a string over a finite alphabet (often a string of 1's and 0s).

Then an evaluation function (like fitness function) is required.
This function is designed based on the specific problem at hand. 

After this the next generation of states is produced by selection, crossover and mutation.
