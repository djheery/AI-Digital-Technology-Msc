# What is Computational Intelligence? 

The lecture starts by asking, what is computational Intelligence? 

My Answer: 

Computational Intelligence is the ability of a computer system to make reasoned decisions computationally. This computational intelligence is gained via selected algorithms that handle given inputs and/or outputs and make some judgement of give some result based on the given data and the task at hand. 

The Lectuer Answer: 

"Also called soft computing, computational Intelligence (CI) deals with situations involving incomplete and inaccurate data or knowledge. It is, in effect the theory, design, application and development of bilogical and linguistically motivated computational paradigms. 

The Thee main pillars of CI (Computational Intelligence) are: 

- Neural Networks 
- Evolutionary Computation 
- Fuzzy Systems 

## Breakdown of the Lecture Answer: 

- Computational Intelligence is also known as Soft Computing 
- CI deals with incomplete and inaccurate data or knowledge 
  - This is why Fuzzy Systems are included in one of the Pillars of CI 
- Computational Intelligence involves the creation of "Linguistically motivated" and "Biological systems. 
  - The process of creating a computationally intelligent system includes: 
    - Theory 
    - Design 
    - Application 
    - Development 
- Three Pillars of CI 
  - Fuzzy Systems 
  - Neural Networks 
  - Evolutionary Computation
