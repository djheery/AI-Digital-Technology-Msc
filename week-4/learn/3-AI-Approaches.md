# AI Approaches 

The slide starts with a diagram of a hierachy tree of Aritificial intelligence. A
An abstract representation of that tree exists below: 

        Artificial Intelligence
      /                        \
Hard Computing            Soft Computing Techinques/
  techniques              Computational Intelligence
     | |                         | |
      V                           V
  Binary Logic                Multi-valued logic 

On one side of the tree the approach includes: 

- Hard Computing Techniques => 
  - Look up these techniques 
- Binary Logic 
  - Logic that revolves around true/ false values 
    - First-order predicate logic 
    - Propositional Logic
