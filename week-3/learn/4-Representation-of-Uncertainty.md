# Representation of Uncertainty

You can represent uncertainty in a variety of ways. 

For example, how can you predict the chance that tomorrow you will recieve a pay rise. 

## Ways of Representing Uncertainty

There are a few key ways of representing uncertainty: 

- Randomness (Probability)
- Fuzziness 
- Random Fuzziness/ Fuzzy-Randomness
- Other methods 
  - Certainty Factor 
  - Dampster-Shafer Theory 

## Randomness (Probability)

Randomness pertains to the "apparent lack of pattern" or the lack of predictability that a given event will occur. 

In theory, random events are influenced by chance that could be determined by experiments. 

In this cirumstance mathmatical fields such as Statistics and Probability theory are used to define how likely a random event is to occur so that these events can be handled when they do. 

## Fuzziness 

Fuziness pertains to: 

- The lack of sharp or clear boundaries 
- The lack of clear membership (Maybe to a set)

Fuzzy Logic is the mathematics concerning what the possible membership of the given data is. 

## Random Fuzziness / Fuzzy Randomness

Random-Fuzziness is the study of both uncertainties that occur due to both: 

- Randomness 
- Fuzziness 

The mathmatics will determine the likely hood that a given event will occur and the membership of the resulting data due to the random event.
