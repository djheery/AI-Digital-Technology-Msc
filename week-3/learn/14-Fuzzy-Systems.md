# Fuzzy Systems 

Fuzzy systems are based on the foundation of:

- Fuzzy Sets 
- Fuzzy logic 

This foundation is used to make sense of 'vagueness' from the given input/output. 

Fuzzy Sets use human concepts of fuzziness and is used most commonly in the format of fuzzy inference systems. 

Fuzzy inference systems have many real-world applications: 

- Aoutomatic Control of subways 
- Auto-Focusing in cameras
  - To enable the right subject in the picture frame to focus on 
- Jitter Removal in video Camcorders
  - Distinguisng between actual movement of the subject and jitters 
- Vacuum Cleaners that use sensors to gather information about the floor and dirt conditions
  - They use this information input it into a fuzzy expert system to choose the right cleaning programme. 

Traditionally, control problems were usually solved using:

Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller (PID)

PID: Mathematical Equations to simulate the behaviours of the controlled system.
