# Sources of Uncertainty

Below are some of the common sources of uncertainty:

- Uncertain Inputs
- Uncertain Knowledge 
- Uncertain Outputs 

## Uncertain Inputs 

Examples of uncertain inputs include: 

- A lack of relevant facts or conditions 
- Missing and Noisy Data 

I am assuming this refers to uncertain input data i.e input data that cannot be fully predicted. 

## Uncertain Knowledge 

Examples of Uncertain Knowledge Include: 

- Multiple causes lead to multiple effects 
- Failure to enumerate all conditions and exceptions 
- Incomplete knowledge of causality in the domain 
  - I.e incomplete domain knowledge 
- Probabilistic/ Stochastic 
- Extremely complex systems

## Uncertain Outputs 

Examples of uncertain outputs include: 

- Abduction and Induction 
  - These are inherently uncertain 
- Incomplete Deductive Inference 
  - This may lead to uncertain output.
