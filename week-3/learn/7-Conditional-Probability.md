# Conditional Probability

A conditional probability is the probability of a given event occuring, given that predetermined event or condition has already occured. 

The equation for this is: 

P(B|A)
  - The probability of event B, given that event A has occured. 

An example from the lecture: 

There are two red marbles and three blue marbles in a jar. 
Two marbles are randomly selected from said jar. 

Find the probability that the second marble is red given that the first marble is blue
  - This is assuming that the first marble has not been replaced in the jar. 

2 / (2+2) = 1/2 or 50% or 0.5

Find the probability that the second marble is blue given that the first marble is red (assuming that the first marble is not replaced in the jar).

3 / (3 + 1) = 3/4 or 75% or 0.75 

b(n) / (b(n) + r(n)) 
  - b(n)
    - B = blue marbles  
    - n = number of marbles of the given function 
  - r(n)
    - r = red marbles 
    - n = number of marbles of the given function. 

## Conditional Probability: Another example

Roll two dice, including one dark blue die and one white die.

What is the probability of having a sum of 11 dots, given that the white die is a 5:

11 - 5 = 6, therefore the white die must be a 6. 

This means that the probability would be 1/6th 

6 / 6 = 1
  - number needed / numbers on a die = result 

## Conditional Probability example continued: 

Roll Two dice. 
Find out the probability of one of the die being 5, given that the sum of dots is 11 when you roll two dice.

In this circumstance there are two chances that 11 will be produced
  - 1 when the white die is 5 and the blue is 6 
  - 1 when the blud die is 5 and the white die is 6

This means that the probability is 1/2 or 50% 

sum = 11
