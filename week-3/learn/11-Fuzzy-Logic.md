# Fuzzy Logic 

Fuzzy logic is used to model vagueness through possible true values.

## Modelling of Imprecise Concepts 

To model imprecise concepts you can use **fuzzy sets**

Imprecise concepts include: 

- Weight 
- Temperature 
- Height 
- Distance 

## Modelling of Imprecise Dependencies 

To model imprecise dependencies you can use **fuzzy sets** 

Imprecise Dependencies could be: 

If the weather is sunny and you are not too busy => Take a walk 
If you're too hot and you have enough icecubes => place the icecubes on your balls. 

## Origin of Information 

To determine the origin of information you can use **fuzzy sets**.

This information could be: 

The modelling of expert knowledge of the representation of information extracted from inherently imprecise data.
