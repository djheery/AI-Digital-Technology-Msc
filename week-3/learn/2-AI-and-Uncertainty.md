# AI and Uncertainty 

The session has started by asking: 

Does AI Handle the Uncertainty in the World? 

My Answer: 

From my limited understanding AI cannot fully handle uncertainty in the world however it can make allowances for it. This references last weeks lecture which stated that first-order predicate logic and propositional logic cannot handle the grey area (the excluded middle) however fuzzy systems may be able to handle it. 

The answer given: 

Yes, Being able to handle the uncertainty of the world is the merit and the challenge of AI.
