# Artificial Itelligence in Context 

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not a single piece of hardware or software, but rather a constellation of technologies. 

Successful Development and fielding of AI technologies depends on a number of interrelated elements that can be envisioned as a Stack. 

- Talent 
  - The humans that implement these technologies are talented in the field of AI.
- Data 
  - Data is critical for most AI systems. Labeled and curated data enables much of current machine learning used to create new applications and improve the performance of existing AI applications. 
- Hardware 
  - The underlying hardware provides the computing power to analuze ever-growing data pools and run applications. This hardware layer includes cloud-based compute and storage, supported by a networking and communications backbone, instrumental for connecting smart sensors and devices at the network edge 
- Algorithms 
  - Algorithms are the mathematical operations that tell the system how to navigate the data to provide answers in responce to specific questions. 
- Applications 
  - An application makes the answers useful for specific tasks. 
- Integration 
  - Integration of these elements is critical to fielding a seccessful end-to-end AI system. this requires significant engineering talent and investment to integrate existing data flows, decision pipelines legacy equipment, testing designs, etc. 


"Within the past 10 years, we have witnessed a “second wave” of AI, propelled by large-scale statistical ML that enables engineers to create models that can be trained to specific problem domains if given exemplar data or simulated interactions. Learning from data, these systems are designed to solve specific tasks and achieve particular goals with competencies that, in some respects, parallel the cognitive processes of humans: perceiving, reasoning, learning, communicating, deciding, and acting. Today most fielded large-scale AI systems employ elements of both first- and second-wave AI approaches."

"We have entered the age of deployed AI" despite the facet that the current technology has "significant limitations". 

## Uses for Deployed AI Today

### Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

This is the processing, analyzing and comprehension of human language. This could either be spoken or written 

Examples: 

- Richer 
- Human-Computer interaction. 
- Chat bots 

### Computer Vision 

Understanding, and learning visual tasks through the world via the use of cameras and sensors. 

Example 

- Livestock Monitoring 
- Automated Driving 

### Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

The use of robots to automate repetitive tasks 
  - RPA Platforms 

### Modeling and Simulation 

Utilizing models of the social world to support the study, optimization and testing of operations through simulation without iterfering or disrupting ongoing processes
