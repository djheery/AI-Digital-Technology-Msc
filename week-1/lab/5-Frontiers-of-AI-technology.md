# Frontiers of AI Tecnology 

"The next decade of AI research will likely be defined by efforts to incorporate existing knowledge, push forward novel ways of learning, and make systems more robust, generalizable, and trustworthy.

Research on advancing human-machine teaning will be at the forefront, as will improvemnts in Hybrid AI techniques, enhanced training methods, and explainable AI. 

## Human-AI Teaming 

Mastering human-AI collaboration and teaming is a foundational element for future application of AI. 

Mastering Human-AI collaboration and teaming is a foundational element for future application of AI. 

Synergy between humans an dAI holds the promise of a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Researchers are addressing this challenge by studying issues of delegated authority, observability, predictability, directability, and trust. 

Gaining greateer understanding of how humans will learn to work with AI will provide insigts for creating effective training programs for humans. 

A critical component of next-generation teaming will be human-like conversation between machine and human. To advance this there will need to be an advancement in language comprehension. 

## Novel Ways of Learning 

"New learning methods are allowing for greater efficiency in both training and inference from data" 

By doing this there is a hope that it will decrease dependence on vast data sets and widen the aperture of systems to handle tasks beyond their original scope. 

Building pathways towrd contextual learning and commonsense reasoning is part of these new ways of learning 

For example, neuro-symbolic research is combining symbolic manipulation with neural networks.3 Model-based and data-based approaches may also be combined; for example, leveraging physics knowledge within statistical ML frameworks.

## Edge Computing 

Breaking size, weight, and power barries increases the ubiquite of AI and aids privacy protection. Companies are working to pack more computetional power into tighter more specialized chips that use less energy to train and run the same models 

Edge computing is the move towards the omnipresence of AI and the ability of users to run AI models on their local machine without having to export the data and source it locally.

##Â Advances in Reasoning 

Advances in reasoning such as commonsense in AI will allow AI systems to generalize their knowledge and transfer that across learning domains. 

An AI system endowed with commonsense reasoning could efectively model the human ability to make and exploit presumptions about the physical properties, purpose, intentions, and behaviour of people and objects and thereby characterize the probably consequences of an action or interaction 

Advances in categorization, and creating generalized structured ontologies, and language understanding will allow machines to learn while understanding context and content which could lead to advancements and the discoving of business solutions which otherwise would take years. 

## Toward More General AI

Humans learn without explicit supervised signals whereas computers need these signals, a movement to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is the movement to this type of learning process. 

AGI refers to a goal of extending AI beyond narrow wedges of expertise and the ability to gain a more generalized knowledge can be transferred.
