# Chapter 1: Emerging Threats in the AI Era 

"AI Applications are transforming existing threats, creating new classes of threats, and further emboldening state and non-state adversaries to exploit vunerablities in our open society".

AI Technologies exacerbate two existing national security challenges: 

## Cyber Intrusion 

As our societies are so digitally dependent cyber intrusion has become a massive vulnerability. 

Corporations, universities, government etc all require an interaction with the internet and cyberspace in genreal. 

The internet of things (IoT) collect data streams which cna be fed into AI systems that can identify, target, and manipulate or coerce our citizens. 

## Cyber Attacks In the Military 

Sate and non-stae adversaries are challenging the United States below the threshold of direct military confrontation by using cyber attacks, espionage, psychological and political warfare. Although AI is not necassary for these kind of attacks, AI is starting to change these attacks in kind and in degree, creating new threats to the U.S. economy, critical infrastructure, and societal cohesion.3.

## AI Attacks that Have been or soon will be developed

- AI Enables Information Operations 
- Data Havesting and Targeting of Individuals 
- Accelerated Cyber Attacks 
- Adversarial AI 
- AI Enabled Biotechnology

### AI Enabled Information Operations 

AI and associated technolgies will increase the magnitued, precision and persistence of adversarial information operations. AI exacerbates the problem of malign information in three ways: 

Message: AI can produce original textpbased content and manipulate images, audi, and video, including through genrative adversarial network (GAN)-enabled and reinforcemnt learning (RL) deep fakes that will be very difficult to distinguish from authentic messages. 

AI can construct profiles of individuals' preferences, bahviors, and beliefs to target specific audiences with specific messages. 

AI can be embedded within platforms, such as through ranking algorithms, to proliferate malign information. 

In lehmans terms, AI can be used to spread disinformation and misinformation to the public on a widespread level. 

### Data Harvesting and Targeting of Individuals 

Data security is a national security problem. "Ad-tech" has become "nastec-tech". Potential adversaries will recognize what every advertiser and social media company knows: AI is a powerful targeting tool. 

We fear that adversaries’ systematic efforts to harvest data on U.S. companies, individuals, and the government is about more than traditional espionage.11 Adversaries will combine widely available commercial data with data acquired illicitly—as in the 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack—to track, manipulate, and coerce individuals.12 

### Accelerated Cyber Attacks 

Malware in the AI era will be able to mutate into thousands of different forms once it is lodged on a computer system. 

Such mutating polymorphic malware already accounts for more than 90% of malicious executable files.16 Deep RL tools can already find vulnerabilities, conceal malware, and attack selectively.17

Vulnerabilities remain open in outdated infrastructure and medical devices, while new vulnerabilities are proliferating in 5G networks, billions of IoT devices, and in software supply chains.20   

Though defensive applications of AI bring the promise to improve our national cyber defenses, AI can’t defend inherently vulnerable digital infrastructure.

## AI-Enabled Biotechnology 

Biology is now programmable. New technologies such as the gene editing tool CRISPR ushered in an era where humans are able to edit DNA. Combined with massive computing power and AI, innovations in biotechnology may provide novel solutions for mankind’s most vexing challenges, including in health, food production, and environmental sustainability. Like other powerful technologies, however, applications of biotechnology can have a dark side.

AI may enable a pathogen to be specifically engineered for lethality or to target a genetic profile—the ultimate range and reach weapon.

ndividuals, societies, and states will have different moral and ethical views and accept different degrees of risk in the name of progress, and U.S. competitors are comparatively likely to take more risk-tolerant actions and conform less rigidly to bioethical norms and standards.
