# Report Introduction 

"AI Technologies promise to be the most powerful tools in generations for expanding knowledge, increasing prosperity and enriching the human experience"

AI Will fuel competiion between governments and companies. 

The report suggests that the United States is not prepared for how AI will change society and that it is underprepared. 

## The maginitude of the Technological Opportunity Concides with a Moment of strategic vulnerability

China and Russia are seen as great threats to democracy in America and AI is seen to be deepening the threat posed by Cyber Attacks and disinformation campaings that Russia and CHina, and other state and non-state actors are using to infiltrate American society. 

The report states that the "limited uses of AI-enabled attacks to date are the tip of the iceberg". 

It also says that AI can help us navigate many new challenges such as global pandemics and global warming.

The commission ahbs conculded that the United states needs to inmplement a strategy to defend and compete int he AI era

## Why Does AI Matter? 

"In 1901, Thomas Edison was asked to predict electricity’s impact on humanity. Two decades after the development of the light bulb, he foresaw a general-purpose technology of unlimited possibilities. “[Electricity] is the field of fields,” he said. “It holds the secrets which will reorganize the life of the world.”2 AI is a very different kind of general-purpose technology, but we are standing at a similar juncture and see a similarly wide-ranging impact.3 "

The improving ability of computer systems to solve problems and to perform tasks and that would otherwise require human intelligence is transforming many aspects of human life and every field of science. 

AI is already in everyday life. 

A smartphone has many AI-enabled features such as:
 
- voice assistants,
- photo taging, 
- facial recognition security, 
- search apps, reccomendation and 
- advertising engines and 
- AI enhnacements to the software in general, which are less obvious. 

It hs he;ped predict the spread and escalation of pandemic 
- Planned and optimzed the distributon of goods and services 
- Monitoring traffic flow and safety
- Speeding up drug and theraputic discovery 
- Automating Routine office functions

## The Deployment 

Deployment of AI will be a struggle even after the science has settled

Many of the most important real-world impacts will come from figuring out how to employ existing AI algorithms and systems, some more than a decade old.

## AI tools are diffusing broadly and Rapidly 

Cutting edge deep learning techniques are often prohibitively expensive, requiring vast amounts of data, computing power, and specialized knowledge. 

Open-source applications and development tools combined with inexpensive cloud computing and less data-intensive approaches are expanding AI opportunities across the world to state and non-state actors.

## AI is changing relationships between Humans and Machines 

Society relies much more on machines and the automation of them than many may be aware. 

The U.S. military, for instance, has used autonomous systems for decade. 

As AI capabilites improve, the dynamics within human-machine teams will change. 

In the past computers could only perform tasks taht fell within clearly defined parametewrs. The improvement in the capability of AI will enable the comuter to learn and perform tasks based on new parameters that are not explicitly programmed. 

## AI For what Ends? 

THe report states that AI is impacting not only international order amongst states but the political order within them. 

The stakes of AIs future are intimately connected between authoritarian and democratic political systems and ideologies. 



"Technology itself does not possess an ideology, but how it is designed, where it is employed, and which laws goven its use reflect the priorites and values of those who design and employ it" 

The differences between states will have less to do with the quality or sophistication of the technology and more to do with the way it is used - for what purpose, and under what rules. 

"Authoritarian regimes will continue to use AI-powered face recognition, biometrics, predictive analytics, and data fusion as instruments of surveillance, influence, and political control. China’s use of AI-powered surveillance technologies to repress its Uyghur minority and monitor all of its citizens foreshadows how authoritarian regimes will use AI systems to facilitate censorship, track the physical movements and digital activities of their citizens, and stifle dissent.4"

"More than half of the world's advanced democracies use AI-enabled surveillance systems."

Using these technologies against the rule of law could lead to democratic backsliding. 

The report advises to lead the way in the use of AI in a democratic manner to "protect the security of its citizens in ways that uphold liberal democracy".
