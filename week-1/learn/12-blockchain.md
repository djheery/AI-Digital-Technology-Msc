# Blockchain, Security and Privacy 

Modern AI implies security and privacy risks. 

This has led to the development of the blockchain, which is a P2P distributed database (ledger) maintaining a list of continuolsuly growing records (blocks) for secure and privacy perserving data transactions. 

Blocks are linked and secured using public key cryptography. Blockchain implements highly secure and privacy-preserving decenteralised systems. 

Transactions are not under the control of any third-party organisations. 

Blockchain usually consists of three types: 

1. Permission-less or public blockchain, which is completely open
2. Private or permissioned blockchain, whcih is based on private or consensus 
3. hybrid blockchain.
