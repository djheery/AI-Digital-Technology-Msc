# Machine Learning 

Machine learning has been a quickly growing field within computer science. Since an early flush of optimisim in the 1950s to smaller subsets of artificial intelligence - first machine-learning then deep-learning (a subset of machine learning) - have created ever larger disruptions. 

## 1950s - 1980s 

Early artificial intelligence models stirred excitement. This era was characterised by the engineering of machines that mimic cognitive functions. They included things like General Problem Solver, and MYCIN programme (Stanford) and Lisp machines. 

## 1980s - 2000s 

In the decades following the 1980s, machine learning began to flourish. Machine learning is the ability to perform tasks without explicit programming or instructions. Relying on patterns. 

Examples of this include TD-Backgammon, Deep Blue and Honda's ASIMO robot. 

## Deep Learning 

Deep learning breaktrhoughs in the 2010s and beyond have driven the AI boom. Deep learning refers to machine learning based on artificial neural networks. 

Examples include Siri, Googles Google Now, Cortana, DeepMind's AlphaGo
