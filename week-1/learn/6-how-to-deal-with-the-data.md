# How to Deal with the Data 

Digitalisation generates a large amount of data, which we need to deal with.

 It is getting increasingly difficult to deal with the data in traditional ways, so automation on data processing and analysis is required. 
 
 Cloud storage is a technology for data storage and computation.
 AI can be seen as the brain for intelligent data processing. Big data tecbnologies and approaches deal with a massive data set where AI plays a key role in processing that data in an optimised fashion to gain information on the dataset.
