# IoT, Big Data and the Cloud. 

On this screen there is a diagram showing the relationship between IoT big data and the cloud 

The IoT encompases data subscription, data acquisition and device management, connected to a cloud based messaging service, 

This messaging service transmits the data to persistent storage where it is transformed, loaded, aggregated and analysed before3 it is sent back and this loop continues. 

See Week 1 slide with this title for the diagram.
