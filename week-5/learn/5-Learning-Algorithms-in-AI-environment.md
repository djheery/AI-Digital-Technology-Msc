# Learning Algorithms in AI Environment 

You could view an artificial intelligence system as a cyclic graph. 
Where different parts of the system can feed back into other parts of the system they have already fed into. 

There is a diagram on Screen 5 of this module that will describe it but I will do my best to write up the process I can see by detailing how it all plays in


There are 2 sides to the System with 3 - 4 stages before reaching the bottom

"==>" represents the algorithm feeding into the list items below 
{n} represents that it is fed back  into by some part of the system
detailed below the list. 
**CP** references the bottom of the diagram. This is a section entitled Computer Programmes, which references the systems that are built with or utilising some AI.

On the right side: 


- Physical world [(Encompasses an AI driven Physical world)] {1}
  - ==>
    - Data {1}
      - ==>
        - Learning Algorithm {1}
        - *Knowledge*
          - ==> **CP**
    - *Knowledge*
      - ==> **CP**

The physical world feeds into the KB and data collection portion of the program which process that data, then sends it into the KB and/or onto the learning algorithm. 

The KB contains the known assertions about the world. 

The data also feeds into the learning algorithm which use the data to make more assertions about the real world.

This is then fed into the computer programmes utilizing this AI system, and the programme will be able to take some input and produce some output based on learning that the AI system has done in some chosen domain. 

{1} = This is the feedback for reinforcement in which each of the section followed by this identifier are fed back the output data for further learning and knowledge 

- Human/Animal Intelligence {2}
  - ==> 
    - Biological/Psychological etc  theory/ models
      - ==> **CP** {2}

Human intelligence is entered into some problem domain theory/ model then this is used to form input into the computer program.
