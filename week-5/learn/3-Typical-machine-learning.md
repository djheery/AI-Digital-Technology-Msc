# Typical Machine Learning 

A typical machine learning process takes data from the physical world and then transforms it into a digital representation. 

This digital representation of the data is then fed into some learning algorithm/s which will encode knowledge which the algorithm learns from the data. 

This will then cause the learned models to be able to take in some input and produce/ predict an output according to the knowledge that it has learned. 

Physical World => Data => Learning Algorithms => Computer Programmes

## Machine Learning with Reinforcement 

This encapsulates the same process as above, however with 2 initial steps.

There is a recursive loop from the "computer programmes" section to the "data" and learning algorithms" section. 

This loop represents that the outputs produced/predicted a machine learning computer programme (which are based on some input) are then fed back into the learning algorithm as extra data to train on, and learn from to asses whether the model produced a "correct" output based on the knowledge or "incorrect" and it should find out why.
