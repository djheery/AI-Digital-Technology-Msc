# Classification 

A classification algorithm is used to predict "classes" in some data set by training on pre-labelled (classified) instances of the data. 

It will then construct models based on the training examples.
An example may be "Labeling input Datasets"

The use of labeled datasets for training is a clear example of **supervised learning**.

After the training portion of the the model, the next step is to label new data instances, which have no labels. 
This is done based on the KB and how the learning algorithm has classified the training data. (Not very well worded)

## Common Approaches To Classification 

- Knowledge-Based Systems and Decision Trees 
- Naive Bayesian Networks and Neural Networks 
- Nature-Inspired Systems 

## Common Applications 

- Prediction 
- Diagnosis of some problem (For example in medicine)
- Finite Label Analysis 

## Difficulties 

- If there is a lack of labeled data to train on, the algorithm will make it's own assumptions which may be incorrect 
- Over-fitting
  - This is when a model learns the training data too well 
    - It learns the detail and the noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on any new enty data. 
      - This is because the concepts that it has gleaned from the training data may not be entirely accurate, leading the algorithm to make false assertions on the datas class instance.
