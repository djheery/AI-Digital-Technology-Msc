# Machine Learning Perspective

A general machine learning algorithm contains 3 processes: 

- Data pre-processing 
- Data Mining 
- Post-processing 

## Data Pre-Processing 

Types of data pre-processing are: 

- Data Integration
- Normalization 
- Dimension Reduction 

## Data Mining 

Data Mining is used on the processed data and the following types of events may occur: 

- Pattern Discovery 
- Association and Correlation
- Classification (algorithm type)
- Clustering (algorithm type)
- Outlier Analysis 

## Post-Processing 

The following events may occur in the post-processing environment: 

- Pattern evaluation 
- Pattern Selection 
- Pattern Interpretation 
- Pattern Visualization
