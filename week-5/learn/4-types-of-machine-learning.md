# Types of Machine Learning

There are a few types of machine learning to explore: 

- Supervised/ Inductive Learning 
- Unsupervised Learning 
- Semi-supervised learning 
- Reinforcement learning 

## Supervised/ Inductive Learning

Supervised/Inductive Learning includes: 
  - Data 
  - Labeling the Data (Also known as supervision)
    - For training purposes 
  - Uses algorithms in the following classes: 
    - Regression 
      - Decision Trees
    - Classification
      - Naive Bayes
      - Neural Networks 

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning Includes 
  - Unlabelled Data 
  - Uses algorithms of the following class:   
    - Clustering 
      - K-Means
      - Fuzzy C-means 

## Semi-Supervised Learning 

Semi supervised learning requires data with some form of labelling, but not necessarily all. 

In other words, this learning process has "some supervision"

## Reinforcement Learning 

This involves the discovery of solutions via the means of trial and error. 

There is usually some form of reward mechanism in place to inform the system of how well it's results performed.
