# Clustering 

Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning Algorithm. 
Rather than using labeled data, it's aim is to find 'natural' data groupings from an un-labeled dataset.
It groups data to form new categories.

These categories are known as clusters. 

## Common Approaches

Common Clustering Approaches Include: 

- K-Mean 
- Fuzzy C-Mean 
- Nearest Neighbor 

## Common Applications 

- Spam Filters 
- Customer Segmentation 

## Difficulties 

- Feature Selection 
- Determining the number of clusters.
