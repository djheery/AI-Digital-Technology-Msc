# Matching 

The condition or premise patterns are the rules that need to be matched with the known facts in working memory.

For example: 

### Rule Base 

IF: x is-a Manufactuer 
  x makes y
  y is rated 5-star 
THEN: x is nominated-for-award 

### Working Memory 

A = manufacturer
B = manufacturer
C = manufacturer
D = manufacturer

A makes T 
C makes V 
B makes W
D makes S

T is 5-star 
W is 5-star 
W is 5-star

E is-a cinema 

### Apply is a manufactuer: 

- x = A 
- x = B
- x = C
- x = D

### Apply is 5-star 

- y = T 
- y = W 

### Bindings for X makes Y 

- x=A, y=T
- x=C, y=V
- x=B, y=W
- x=D, y=S

### Possible Bindings that meet the rule

- x=A, y=T
- x=B, y=W

### Outcomes 

- A is nominated for award
- B is nominated for award
