# Knowledge-Based Systems 

Reasoning reflects the decision making or problem-solving process of human beings.

Propositional logic and predicate logic are common formal approaches to mimic human common sense reasonings. 
This is where propositions and predicates are used to represent knowledge and propositional or predicate calculus is used to reason on knowledge. 

Knowledge based systems are computer systems that reason based on a KB (knowledge base) in a specialist subject for problem-solving. 

Expert systems are one particular group of knowledge-based systems aiming to replace or aid human experts for domain-specific tasks.
Expert systems mimic the working process of human experts using domain knowledge to make a deduction. 

## Expert Systems 

- Aim to capture the knowledge of an expert within the problem domain 
- Allow a non-expert to solve complex problems
  - This could be diagnosing an illness or an issue with a car amongst other things 
- Often used as a support tool for expert to help provide a second opinion without the consultation of other experts 
  - This is the most common use
- Follow path(s) from one place in the tree to another to solve a problem
- Widely used in commercial products
- Represented as a collection of interrelated rules that are organised in a tree-like structure
