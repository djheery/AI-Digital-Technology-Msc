# Predicate Logic 

Review the example: 

- Every bird can fly
- A Penguin is a bird 
- Deduce that a penguin can fly 

In propositional logic, only the logical forms of compund propositions are analysed. 

A simple propsition is unanalysed that is either true or false. The previous example shows that predicate logic is able to identify individuals or subset of a group, such as a penguuin together with their properties and predicates. This is the objective of predicate calculus. 

Predicate calculus gives the underpinnings to the languages of logic programming such as PROLOG. 

In addition, predicate calculus is increasingly used for specifying the requirements of computer applications.

In the area of proving programme correctness, predicate calculus allows one to precisely state under which conditions a programme gives the correct output.
