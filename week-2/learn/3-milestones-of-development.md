# Milestones of Development 

## 1930s - 1950s 

- 1931: Kurt Godel demonstrates that in first-order predicate logic, all true statements are derivable. By contrast, in higher order logics, there are true statements that are unproveable 
- 1937: Alan Turing shows the limits of intelligent machines via the **halting problem**
- 1943: McCulloch and Pitts model nueral networks and show the relation to propositional logic 
- 1950: Alan turing defines machine intelligence using the **Turing Test** as well as describing learning machines and **genetic algorithms**
- 1951: Marvin Minsky develops a neural network 
- 1955: Arthur Samuel (IBM) creates a learning chess programme that can outplay its developer 
- 1956: McCarthy organises a conference in Dartmouth college in which the term 'Artificial Intelligence' is introduced
- 1956: Newell and Simon reveal the Logic Theorist - The first computer programme able to process symbols 
- 1958: McCarthy at MIT develops LISP, a high-level language. He writes programes that can modify themselves. 
- 1959: Gelernter (IBM) builds the **Geometry Theorem Prover**

## 1960s - 1980s 

- 1961: The **General Problem Solver** imitates human thought. 
- 1963: McCarthy establishes the AI lab at Stanford Uni 
- 1966: An AI Programme developed by Weizenbaum, holds dialogue with people in natural language, the programme is named Eliza. 
- 1972: PROLOG is invented. It is a logic programming language
- 1972: A British physician pioneers an expert system to diagnose accute abdominal pain. It is largely ignored by the mainstream AI community 
- 1976: Shortliffe and Buchanan develop an expert system for diagnosing infectious diseases and name it MYCIN. It is capable of dealing with uncertainty.
- 1981: Japan begins the Fith Generation Project with the goal of building a powerful PROLOG machine. 
- 1982: Digital Equipment Corporation saves $40 million per year thanks to R1, an expert system for configuring computers. 
- 1986: There is a renaissance of neural networks thanks to Rumelhart, Hinton and Sejnowski

## 1990s-2000s

- 1990: Probability theory is introduced to AI with Bayesian networks.
- 1993: TD-Gammon backgammon programme shows the benefits of reinforcement learning 
- 1995: Vapnik develops SVM using statistical learning theory. Support Vector Machines remain popular to this day 
- 1997: Deep Blue, defeats the chess world champion (IBM)
- 2006: Service Robitics becomes a majoir AI research Area

## 2000s - Present 

- 2010: Autonomous robots start learning their policies 
- 2011: Two human champions of the US quiz show Jeopardy! are defeated by IBMâ€™s natural language understanding and question answering programme known as Watson. 
- 2016: Google Launches its DeepMind's AlphaGo 
- 2019: DeepMind's AlphaStar is introduced
