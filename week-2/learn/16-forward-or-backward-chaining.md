# Foward Or Backward Chaining 

Essentially you should use forward chaining if you know the goal and backward chaining if you do not. 
During the process, you should move from smaller sets of stages to larger sets.

IN other words, the goal set or fact set, whichever is smaller

Forward chaining can be used to solve the arrivl of new facts, while backwards chaining can be used to respond to a query.
