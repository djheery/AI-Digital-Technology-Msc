# Logic 

The term logic comes from Greek Philosophy, in particular the work of Aristotle.

Aristotle's logic revolves around one notion: The Deduction (syllogisms)

**sylogisms**: A form of resoning in which a conclusion is drawn from two given or assumed premesises (propositions)

Also known as deductive reasoning. 

A quote from Barnes (1994, p.251):

'A Deduction is speech in which, certain things having been supposed, something different from those supposed results of necessity because of their being so'.

Whilst the statement abbove may be confusing consider: 

Where the statement says 'supposed' consider these arguments or premises. 
Where the statement says 'results of necessity' consider this the conclusion.

Taking this into account it is reasonable to assume that the statement means something along the lines of: 

A deduction is the process of forming premisses and gaining the resulting conculsions as a result of these premisesses. 

It must contain a subject and a predicate and must either affirm or deny the predicate of the subject. 

Predicate: Something which is affirmed or denied based on an argument of a proposition (subject).

This means that every assertation is either the affirmation or denial of a single predicate of a single subject. 

Subject may be either individual or universal, but predicates can only be universal: 

For example: 

- Major Premise: All humans are mortal 
- Minor Premise: All British humans are mortal
- Conclusion: All British are mortal

- Major Premise: All winged mammals are birds
- Minor Premise: All blue tits are birds
- Conclusion: All blue tits are mammals

- Major Premise: All fish can swim
- Minor Premise: All salmons are fish
- Conclusion: All salmons can swim
