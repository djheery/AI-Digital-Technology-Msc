# AI System Architecture

This is the basic architecture for an AI system: 

- Expert 
  - <= Knowledge Aquisition System =>         <==User==>
    - <= Knowledge Base =>              - <= Usert Interface || 
                - <-Explanation system->               V=======    
                                        - <- Context ->
                - <-Inference Enging ->


Notated: 

A Basic architecture for an AI system: 

- An expert interacts with a knowledge aquisition system.
  - The knowledge aquision system exchanges knowledge with a knowledge base 
    - This knowledge base then exchanges its knowledge with with an inference enging and explanation system.
      - The explanation system and inference systems exchange facts based on context 
        - This context exchanges data with the user interface 
          - A User interacts with a user interface
            - The user interface exchanges explanation with the explanation system
