# Learning Heuristics From Experience

One way to invent a heuristic:

- Devise a relaxed problem, for which an optimal solution can be easily found. 

Another 

- Learn from experience using metallevel state pace and a meta-level training algorithm 

A learning algorithm is such thata function h can approximate the true path cost for other states that arise during search. 

Most of these approcaches learn an imperfect approximation to the heuristic function and thus risk inadmissibility. 

This leaves a tradeof between learning time, serach run time, and solution cost.
