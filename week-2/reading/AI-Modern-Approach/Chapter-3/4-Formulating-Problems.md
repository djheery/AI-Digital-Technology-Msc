# Formulating Problems

The Formulation of the city to city probelm is called a **Model**. 

A Model is an abstract mathmatical description which does not exist in the real world (not a real thing.).

In the real world, there would be many more considerations, the weather conditions, the proximity of the next service station, the speed limit of the road. Whereas in our simple Model we are only looking at the distance to the goal state being the city to get to. 

This process of removing detail is known as **Abstraction**.
  - A good probelm has the right level of detail
    - Too much will cloud the judgement of the agent 
    - Too little will create innacurate models with no clear objective 

Good Abstraction is removing as much detail as possible while retainign validity and ensuring that the abstract actions are easy to carry out.

Without relevant abstractions intelligent agents would be completly swamped in the real world with an overload of information.
