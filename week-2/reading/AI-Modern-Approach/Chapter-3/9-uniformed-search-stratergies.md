# Uniformed Search Stratergies 

A Uniformed search algorithm is given no clue about how close a state is to it's goal. 

For example consider our agent from Luton with the goal of reaching leeds. 
With no knowledge of British Georgraphy an uninformed agent doesn't know which is the better step Nottingham or Birmingham.
