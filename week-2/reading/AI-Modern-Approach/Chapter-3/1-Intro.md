# Solving Problems By Searching Intro 

**Definition**

**Agent**: An agent in AI also could be called an **Intelligent Agent**. 

According to wikipedia it could be anything which 

- Percieves it's environment 
- Takes actions autonomously in order to achieve assigned Goals 
- Improve its performance with learning or a predefined knowledge base. 

Examples of an agent:

- Thermostat
- Robot gripper 

Wikipedia states the some AI textbooks state the AI is the study and design of intelligent Agents.

An Agent has an objective and a function. 

# Intro Statement 

Solving problems by searching  

"In which we see how an agent can look ahead to find a sequence of actions that will eventually achieve it's goal."

There are times that an agent (Intelligent agent) may need to plan ahead due to the correct action to take not being obvious. 

The plan could be considered a sequence of actions that the agent will take to acheive a goal state. 

This kind of agent is known as a problem solving agent

The computational process a problem solving agent undertakes is called search. 

In this chapter we will only consider the simplest environments: 

- Episodic
- Single Agent 
- Fully Observable
- Deterministic 
- Static 
- Discrete 
- Known 

We will distinguish between: 
  - Informed Algorithms 
  - Uninformed Algorithms.
