# Search In Complex Environments 

The previous chapter addressed problems in the following environments where the solution is a sequence of actions: 

- Observable
- Deterministic
- Static 
- Known 

This chapter relaxes those constraints. 

It will Cover: 

- The problem of finding a good state, without worrying about the path needed to get there 
  - Covers both discrete state 
  - Continuous State 
- Relax the assumptions of determinism and observability
