# Conjunctive Normal Form 

The resolution rule applies only to clauses (that is, disjunctions of literals)/

Every sentence of propositional logic is logically equivalent to a conjunction of clauses. 

A sentence expressed as a conjunction of clauses is said to be in **conjunctive normal form** (CNF)
