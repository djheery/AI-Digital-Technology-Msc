# Logic 

A logic must define the semantics of sentences. (Semantics = meaning)
The semantics defines the truth of each sentence with respect to each possible environment/ world. 

For example 

x + y = 3

This is true in an envrionment where:

x = 1;
y = 3; 

(or visa versa)

but not in an envrionment where: 

x = 5;
y = 2;

In standard logic every sentence must either be true or false

## Models 

Models are mathematical abstractions of a "possible world". 
Each model has a fixed truth value for every relevant sentence the agent percievs. 

α = sentence 

If a sentence (α) is true in model m It is said that:

 m satisfies α 

Or sometimes it may be said:

that m is a model of α

This can be notated as: 

M(α)

## Logical Entailment 

Logical entailment is the idea that a sentence follows logically from another sentence. 
In mathmatical notation this is: 

α ╞ β

This means directly 

sentence α is true therefore sentence β is true
