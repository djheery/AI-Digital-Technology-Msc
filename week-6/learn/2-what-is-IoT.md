# What is IoT? 

Definition for IoT 

IoT refers to the nature of how clients interact with the internet via various devices. All of these devices feed to servers which harvest this data to gain insights for various reasons

Given Definitions: 

The term 'internet of things' (IoT) is the concept of interconnecting various physical devices and sensors via the internet all across the world. 

The term IoT was first proposed by Kevin Ashton in 1999.

IoT is a service facilitated by utilizing the internet.
The physical equipment serves as either an input or output device (or both). 

This means that a network of physical objects is created, these object can be controlled over the internet.

Examples of these objects include: 

- Vehicles 
- Fridges 
- Smart Devices 
- Ovens 
- Anything that is connected to the internet with embeded electronics. 

Networks can sense and control the physical objects by collecting data from them. 

This creates a direct interaction environment between the physical object and computer bbased systems. 

The outcome that IoT has on the operations which these devices perform are: 

- Improved Efficiency 
- Improved Accuracy
- Improve Longevity 

IoT also alows a user to gain further insight into the devices which they use.
